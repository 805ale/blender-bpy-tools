# 🛠️ Blender BPY Tools

A collection of **Blender Python (bpy)** add-ons and scripts I’m building while learning **technical art workflows**.  
This repo documents my progress and experiments — from simple object panels to custom operators and tools.

## 📚 Learning Goals
- Learn Blender Python (`bpy`) for automation and tool creation.
- Build add-ons that streamline repetitive art tasks.
- Document the journey (notes, screenshots, scripts).

## 🔧 How to Use
1. Download the `.py` file from any script folder.  
2. In Blender: **Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Install...**  
3. Select the `.py` file → enable the add-on.  
4. Find the new panel/operator in the UI (usually in the 3D View sidebar `N` menu).
